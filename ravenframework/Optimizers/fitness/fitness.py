  Efficient Parameter-less Feasible First Penalty Fitness method
  This method is designed for minimization problems. For maximization, the fitness values are negated.
  For minimization problems:
  1.  As the objective decreases, the fitness value increases.
  2.  As the objective increases, the fitness value decreases.
  3.  If a solution violates constraints, the fitness decreases, making it less favorable.
  For maximization problems, the objective value is negated, inverting the trends.
  Reference: Deb, Kalyanmoy. "An efficient constraint handling method for genetic algorithms."

  This is a weighted generalization of Deb (2000): with a_i = 1 and b_i = 1 the two branches reduce
  exactly to Deb's parameter-less scheme; a_i and b_i let the user re-weight the objective and the
  penalty. Following Deb, obj_{worstFeasible} is the worst objective among the FEASIBLE individuals
  (not the whole population), which guarantees every feasible solution outranks every infeasible one
  and orders infeasibles purely by total violation. When no feasible individual exists yet, the
  whole-population worst objective is used as a fallback anchor.
